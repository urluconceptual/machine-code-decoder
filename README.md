# machine-code-decoder
## The first project implemented for the Computer Architecture course. Decoding and evaluation of hexadecimal machine code, implemented in Assembly x86 (AT&amp;T).

The decoder receives as input hexadecimal instructions (simple arithmetic expressions in Polish postfix notation) as the machine code for an imaginary processor and outputs the evaluated expression.
Implemented in 4 parts:
* [task 1](task1.asm): decoding the input
* [task 2](task2.asm): evaluating expressions without variables
* [task 3](task3.asm): evaluating expressions with variables
* [task 4](task4.asm): adapting the code for simple operations with matrices
